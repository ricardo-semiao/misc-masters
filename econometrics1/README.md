# Empirical Work: Effect of Family Size in Children Quality

This is the repository associated with the empirical work required at the class Econometrics I, from FGV-EESP's masters in Economics course.

The task is described at [Instructions.pdf](Instructions.pdf), but basically entails the replication of works in the literature of “quantity-quality trade-off”, a la Becker and Lewis (1973) and Becker and Tomes (1976). The finished report is [text.pdf](text.pdf).

The data comes from IPUMS International, the Puerto Rico 2010's census, and is at [Data/](Data/). The main script is [main.R](main.R), and the report is built with [text.tex](text.tex).
