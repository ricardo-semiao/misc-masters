The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads                                                         2025-04-08       Current
between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category
and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each
constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The
Corporate Master OAS uses an index of bonds that are considered
investment grade (those rated BBB or better). When the last calendar
day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will
occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.  This
data represents the ICE BofA US Corporate Index value, which tracks
the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated
corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify
for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade
rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an
investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of
Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt
ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining
maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of
$250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, "global" securities
(debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond
markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle
notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual
securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first
call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided
they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one
year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a
fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted
securities are excluded from the Index.  ICE BofA Explains the
Construction Methodology of this series as: Index constituents are
capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding.
With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured
products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming
next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through
and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day
settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the
month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then
are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any
reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is
rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information
available up to and including the third business day before the last
business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria
are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no
longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the
Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are
removed from the Index.  When the last calendar day of the month takes
place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of
month ending accrued interest adjustments.  Certain indices and index

Markets Corporate Plus Index
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLEMCBPITRIV?cid=32413), which
tracks the performance of US dollar (USD) and Euro denominated
emerging markets non-sovereign debt publicly issued within the major
domestic and Eurobond markets. To qualify for inclusion in the index,
the issuer of debt must have risk exposure to countries other than
members of the FX G10 (US, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Canada,
Sweden, UK, Switzerland, Norway, and Euro Currency Members), all
Western European countries, and territories of the US and Western
European countries. Each security must also be denominated in USD or
Euro with a time to maturity greater than 1 year and have a fixed
coupon. For inclusion in the index, investment grade rated bonds of
qualifying issuers must have at least 250 million (Euro or USD) in
outstanding face value, and below investment grade rated bonds must
have at least 100 million (Euro or USD) in outstanding face value. The
index includes corporate and quasi-government debt of qualifying
countries, but excludes sovereign and supranational debt. Other types
of securities acceptable for inclusion in this index are: original
issue zero coupon bonds, "global" securities (debt issued in the US
domestic bond markets as well the Eurobond Market simultaneously),
144a securities, pay-in-kind securities (includes toggle notes),
callable perpetual securities (qualify if they are at least one year
from the first call date), fixed-to-floating rate securities (qualify
if the securities are callable within the fixed rate period and are at
least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond
transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security). Defaulted
securities are excluded from the Index. ICE BofA Explains the
Construction Methodology of this series as: Index constituents are
capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding.
With the exception of US mortgage pass-throughs and US structured
products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming
next-day settlement. Accrued interest for US mortgage pass-through and
US structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement.
Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are
retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed
as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income
while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last
calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and
including the third business day before the last business day of the
month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the
Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria
during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next
month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.
When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend,
weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued
interest adjustments.  Certain indices and index data included in FRED

Notes
The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads                                                         2025-04-08       Current
between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category
and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each
constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The ICE
BofA High Yield Master II OAS uses an index of bonds that are below
investment grade (those rated BB or below). This data represents the
ICE BofA US High Yield Index value, which tracks the performance of US
dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt
publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in
the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based
on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade
rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch
foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must
have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon
schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original
issue zero coupon bonds, "global" securities (debt issued
simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a
securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify
for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify
provided they are at least one year from the first call date.
Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are
callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from
the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a
floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are
excluded from the Index.  ICE BofA Explains the Construction
Methodology of this series as: Index constituents are
capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding.
With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured
products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming
next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through
and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day
settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the
month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then
are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any
reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is
rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information
available up to and including the third business day before the last
business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria
are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no
longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the
Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are
removed from the Index.  When the last calendar day of the month takes
place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of
month ending accrued interest adjustments.  Certain indices and index

as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise
liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the
lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted
average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the
effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate is
essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal
Reserve through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate
target.(2)  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times
a year to determine the federal funds target rate. As previously
stated, this rate influences the effective federal funds rate through
open market operations or by buying and selling of government bonds
(government debt).(2) More specifically, the Federal Reserve decreases
liquidity by selling government bonds, thereby raising the federal
funds rate because banks have less liquidity to trade with other
banks. Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying
government bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have
excess liquidity for trade. Whether the Federal Reserve wants to buy
or sell bonds depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC
believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are
inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the
Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target to temper
economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a lower
federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity.
Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to
determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize
economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by
Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers
a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages,
employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and
foreign exchange markets.  The federal funds rate is the central
interest rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other
interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge
their customers with higher credit ratings. Additionally, the federal
funds rate indirectly influences longer- term interest rates such as
mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to
consumer wealth and confidence.(2)  References (1) Federal Reserve

became effective January 9, 2003.   Primary credit is available to
generally sound depository institutions at a rate set relative to the
Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) target range for the federal
funds rate. Depository institutions are not required to seek
alternative sources of funds before requesting advances of primary
credit. Primary credit may be used for any purpose, including
financing the sale of federal funds. By making funds readily available
at the primary credit rate the primary credit program complements open
market operations in the implementation of monetary policy. Reserve
Banks ordinarily do not require depository institutions to provide
reasons for requesting very short-term primary credit. Rather,
borrowers are asked to provide only the minimum information necessary
to process a loan, usually the amount and term of the loan.  This rate
replaces that for adjustment credit, which was discontinued after
January 8, 2003. For further information, see Board of Governor's
announcement
(https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2002/200210312/).
The rate reported is that for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

for policymakers, but challenging because the crisis has unfolded with
extreme speed. We identify three indicators: stock market volatility,
newspaper-based economic uncertainty, and subjective uncertainty in
business expectation surveys that provide real-time forward-looking
uncertainty measures. We use these indicators to document and quantify
the enormous increase in economic uncertainty in the past several
weeks.     For more information, see Baker, Scott, Nicholas Bloom and

The overnight bank funding rate is calculated using federal funds                                                              2025-04-09       Current
transactions and certain Eurodollar transactions. The federal funds
market consists of domestic unsecured borrowings in U.S. dollars by
depository institutions from other depository institutions and certain
other entities, primarily government-sponsored enterprises, while the
Eurodollar market consists of unsecured U.S. dollar deposits held at
banks or bank branches outside of the United States. U.S.-based banks
can also take Eurodollar deposits domestically through international
banking facilities (IBFs). The overnight bank funding rate (OBFR) is
calculated as a volume-weighted median of overnight federal funds
transactions and Eurodollar transactions reported in the FR 2420
Report of Selected Money Market Rates. Volume-weighted median is the
rate associated with transactions at the 50th percentile of
transaction volume. Specifically, the volume-weighted median rate is
calculated by ordering the transactions from lowest to highest rate,
taking the cumulative sum of volumes of these transactions, and
identifying the rate associated with the trades at the 50th percentile
of dollar volume. The published rates are the volume-weighted median
transacted rate, rounded to the nearest basis point. For more

RP transactions reported by the New York Fed as part of the Temporary
Open Market Operations.  Temporary open market operations involve
short-term repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements that are
designed to temporarily add or drain reserves available to the banking
system and influence day-to-day trading in the federal funds market.
A repurchase agreement (known as repo or RP) is a transaction in which
the New York Fed under the authorization and direction of the Federal
Open Maker Committee buys a security from an eligible counterparty
under an agreement to resell that security in the future. For these
transactions, eligible securities are U.S. Treasury instruments,
federal agency debt and the mortgage-backed securities issued or fully
guaranteed by federal agencies.

RRP transactions reported by the New York Fed as part of the Temporary
Open Market Operations.  Temporary open market operations involve
short-term repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements that are
designed to temporarily add or drain reserves available to the banking
system and influence day-to-day trading in the federal funds market.
A reverse repurchase agreement (known as reverse repo or RRP) is a
transaction in which the New York Fed under the authorization and
direction of the Federal Open Market Committee sells a security to an
eligible counterparty with an agreement to repurchase that same
security at a specified price at a specific time in the future. For
these transactions, eligible securities are U.S. Treasury instruments,
federal agency debt and the mortgage-backed securities issued or fully
guaranteed by federal agencies. For more information, see

of St. Louis and S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC have reached a new
agreement on the use of Standard & Poors and Dow Jones Averages series

market. The index includes 500 leading companies in leading industries
of the U.S. economy, which are publicly held on either the NYSE or

Notes
This series is a measure of expected inflation (on average) over the                                                           2025-04-08       Current
five-year period that begins five years from today.    This series is
constructed as:
(((((1+((BC_10YEAR-TC_10YEAR)/100))^10)/((1+((BC_5YEAR-TC_5YEAR)/100))^5))^0.2)-1)*100
where BC10_YEAR, TC_10YEAR, BC_5YEAR, and TC_5YEAR are the 10 year and
5 year nominal and inflation adjusted Treasury securities.   Starting
with the update on June 21, 2019, the Treasury bond data used in
calculating interest rate spreads is obtained directly from the U.S.
Treasury Department

Series is calculated as the spread between 3-Month LIBOR based on US                                                           2022-01-28       Current
dollars (USD3MTD156N) and 3-Month Treasury Bill (DTB3
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTB3)). Starting with the update
on June 21, 2019, the Treasury bond data used in calculating interest
rate spreads is obtained directly from the U.S. Treasury Department
(https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield).
The 3-Month LIBOR based on US Dollars has been removed from FRED
(https://news.research.stlouisfed.org/2022/01/ice-benchmark-administration-ltd-iba-data-to-be-removed-from-fred/)
as of January 31, 2022, so this calculated series has been
discontinued and will no longer be updated. Users interested in
calculating a similar credit risk can use the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (SOFR), which has been identified as the rate that
represents best practice for use in certain new U.S. Dollar
derivatives and other financial contracts. For more details, see the
article Transition from LIBOR
(https://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc/sofr-transition) from the Alternative
Reference Rates Committee (AARC).

Development (OECD) Composite Leading Indicators: Reference Turning
Points and Component Series data, which can be found at
http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/oecdcompositeleadingindicatorsreferenceturningpointsandcomponentseries.htm.
The OECD identifies months of turning points without designating a
date within the month that turning points occurred. The dummy variable
adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a
specific date within the month. The arbitrary convention does not
reflect any judgment on this issue by the OECD. Our time series is
composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and
recession. A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0
is an expansionary period. For this time series, the recession begins
on the 15th day of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th day of
the month of the trough. This time series is a disaggregation of the
monthly series. For more options on recession shading, see the note
and links below.  The recession shading data that we provide initially
comes from the source as a list of dates that are either an economic
peak or trough. We interpret dates into recession shading data using
one of three arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is
available using all three interpretations. The period between a peak
and trough is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are
collectively extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both
individually and collectively, may be included in the recession period
in whole or in part. In situations where a portion of a period is
included in the recession, the whole period is deemed to be included
in the recession period.  The first interpretation, known as the
midpoint method, is to show a recession from the midpoint of the peak
through the midpoint of the trough for monthly and quarterly data. For
daily data, the recession begins on the 15th of the month of the peak
and ends on the 15th of the month of the trough. Daily data is a
disaggregation of monthly data. For monthly and quarterly data, the
entire peak and trough periods are included in the recession shading.
This method shows the maximum number of periods as a recession for
monthly and quarterly data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses
this method in its own publications. The midpoint method is used for
this series.  The second interpretation, known as the trough method,
is to show a recession from the period following the peak through the
trough (i.e. the peak is not included in the recession shading, but
the trough is). For daily data, the recession begins on the first day
of the first month following the peak and ends on the last day of the
month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data.
The trough method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. A
version of this time series represented using the trough method can be
found at:  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USARECD  The third
interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a recession from
the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is included in the
recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily data, the
recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak and ends on
the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data is a
disaggregation of monthly data. A version of this time series
represented using the peak method can be found at:
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USARECDP  The OECD CLI system is
based on the "growth cycle" approach, where business cycles and
turning points are measured and identified in the deviation-from-trend
series. The main reference series used in the OECD CLI system for the
majority of countries is industrial production (IIP) covering all
industry sectors excluding construction. This series is used because
of its cyclical sensitivity and monthly availability, while the broad
based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used to supplement the IIP
series for identification of the final reference turning points in the
growth cycle.  Zones aggregates of the CLIs and the reference series
are calculated as weighted averages of the corresponding zone member
series (i.e. CLIs and IIPs).  Up to December 2008 the turning points
chronologies shown for regional/zone area aggregates or individual
countries are determined by the rules established by the National
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in the United States, which have
been formalized and incorporated in a computer routine (Bry and
Boschan) and included in the Phase-Average Trend (PAT) de-trending
procedure. Starting from December 2008 the turning point detection
algorithm is decoupled from the de-trending procedure, and is a
simplified version of the original Bry and Boschan routine. (The
routine parses local minima and maxima in the cycle series and applies
censor rules to guarantee alternating peaks and troughs, as well as
phase and cycle length constraints.)  The components of the CLI are
time series which exhibit leading relationship with the reference
series (IIP) at turning points. Country CLIs are compiled by combining
de-trended smoothed and normalized components. The component series
for each country are selected based on various criteria such as
economic significance; cyclical behavior; data quality; timeliness and
availability.  OECD data should be cited as follows: OECD Composite
